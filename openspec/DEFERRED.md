### [PHASE4+] Slide 1 Geometry Parity Verification (ARCHIVED 29-10-25)

- **Priority:** P2
- **Estimated effort:** 2-3h
- **Context:** Visual diff workflow to compare generated Slide 1 vs template for EMU/legend discrepancies
- **Reason archived:** No client issues reported. Current validation sufficient.

### [PHASE4+] Visual Diff Workflow Enhancement (ARCHIVED 29-10-25)

- **Priority:** P3
- **Estimated effort:** 2-4h
- **Context:** Automated visual comparison using Zen MCP + PowerPoint Compare
- **Reason archived:** Structural validator + data validation suite sufficient. Low ROI.

### [PHASE4+] Python Normalization Expansion (ARCHIVED 29-10-25)

- **Priority:** P3
- **Estimated effort:** Varies
- **Context:** Additional normalization features for future template changes
- **Reason archived:** Current 8-step workflow handles all known requirements. No new features needed. Will add on-demand if template changes.

### [PHASE4+] Automated Regression Scripts (ARCHIVED 29-10-25)

- **Priority:** P3
- **Estimated effort:** 4-6h
- **Context:** CI/CD integration for automated regression testing on deck generation
