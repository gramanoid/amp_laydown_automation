# 21 Oct 2025 — End-of-Day Summary

## Highlights
- Built and executed `tools/PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1` to merge campaign-name blocks and monthly totals via PowerPoint COM, enforcing header/body font sizes (7 pt/6 pt) and 8.4 pt row heights across the generated decks.
- Normalised percentage formatting and campaign typography in the latest deck (`output/presentations/run_20251021_185319/GeneratedDeck_20251021_MergedCells.pptx`), confirming structural validation still passes.
- Investigated persistent tall rows on multiple slides, identifying the monthly-total merge as non-idempotent when the script reprocesses an existing deck.

## Blockers / Risks
- Row heights on Slides 2/3/5/16 remain >8.4 pt because repeated COM runs keep prior column merges. Requires an explicit unmerge pre-pass before tomorrow’s rerun.
- Pytest suite is currently absent (historical tests removed); automated validation coverage is pending, so regressions rely on manual COM probes.

## Repository Map
- `tools/PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1` — new COM helper that merges campaign ranges and enforces fonts/heights.
- `docs/21_10_25/` — captures today’s investigation, screenshots, and bootstrap prompt.
- No new production code directories were added; several `tests/` modules remain deleted/unrestored in working tree.

## Next Focus
1. Make the COM post-processor idempotent by unmerging columns 1–3 before applying campaign/monthly-total merges.
2. Re-run the script + row-height probe on the latest deck and archive the findings.
3. Reintroduce an automated validation pathway to guard against future merge regressions.
