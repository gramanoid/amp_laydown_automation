# 20 Oct 2025 – Work Log

## What Changed
- Reworked `apply_table_borders` to emit spec-compliant DrawingML (dropped unsupported cap/alignment/headEnd attributes) so clone decks open cleanly in PowerPoint COM.
- Regenerated the clone presentation (`output/presentations/run_20251020_121840/GeneratedDeck_Task11_fixed.pptx`, 114 slides) and re-ran the targeted pytest suite.
- Copied the run output to `AMP_Presentation_20251020_121840_clone.pptx` and executed `tools/visual_diff.py`, which now exports all 114 generated slide PNGs (template export still only contains the master slide).
- Cloned and installed `zen-mcp-server` locally under `temp/zen-mcp-server` (editable pip install) so MCP launches are available inside Codex CLI.

## Validations
- `python -m pytest tests/test_tables.py tests/test_assembly_split.py`
- PowerPoint COM open check on `GeneratedDeck_Task11_fixed.pptx` (114 slides reported, no repair prompts).
- `python tools/visual_diff.py` → completes export; diff thresholds currently fail because the template baseline only covers Slide 1.

## Next Actions
- Build a 114-slide template baseline (golden deck or expanded template export) so visual diff metrics can run to completion.
- Feed generated/template PNG pairs into the Zen MCP server for multimodal verification once the baseline exists.
- Perform PowerPoint Review→Compare for manual sign-off and capture artefacts.
