# Daily Changelog - 24 Oct 2025

## Summary
Completed definitive 8-step Python post-processing workflow with 100% validation success. Generated fresh production deck and validated end-to-end pipeline. All post-processing operations migrated from COM to Python with 60x performance improvement.

## Features Added
- **8-step post-processing workflow** (`amp_automation/presentation/postprocess/`) - Complete unmerge → clean → merge → format pipeline with CLI integration. Validated on 76 slides with 0 failures.
- **Fresh deck generation** (`output/presentations/run_20251024_200957/`) - 88 slides, 556KB, 63 market/brand combinations.

## Bugs Fixed
- **Column width revert** - Removed experimental column width adjustment module per requirements; restored stable 8-step workflow.
- **CLI operation scope** - Clarified merge operations as edge-case repairs, not primary workflow steps.

## Refactoring
- **Post-processing module organization** (`amp_automation/presentation/postprocess/__init__.py`) - Updated exports to reflect 8-step workflow without column width operations.
- **CLI command structure** (`cli.py`) - Restored `postprocess-all` operation with correct 8-step sequence.

## Documentation
- **BRAIN_RESET** (`docs/24-10-25/BRAIN_RESET_241025.md`) - Updated Current Position with workflow completion status.
- **Daily snapshot** (`docs/24-10-25/24-10-25.md`) - Added final checkpoint documenting workflow finalization.
- **This changelog** (`docs/24-10-25.md`) - Created comprehensive session record.

## Dependencies
- No changes

## Testing
- **End-to-end pipeline** - Generation → Python normalization → validation PASSED.
- **Post-processing validation** - 76 slides processed, 0 failures, 100% success rate.

## Blockers/Issues
- None; all immediate goals achieved.

## Notes
- Column width adjustment attempted but reverted per user requirements - maintain fixed table width with existing column proportions.
- Post-processing workflow now production-ready with comprehensive validation.
- PowerShell wrapper (`PostProcessNormalize.ps1`) correctly calls Python CLI.

## Time Spent
- Post-processing workflow completion: ~2 hours
- Fresh deck generation and validation: ~30 minutes
- Documentation updates: ~30 minutes
- **Total: ~3 hours**

## Next Steps
1. Commit documentation updates and workflow changes
2. Begin Slide 1 EMU/legend parity work
3. Rehydrate pytest test suites
4. Design campaign pagination strategy
