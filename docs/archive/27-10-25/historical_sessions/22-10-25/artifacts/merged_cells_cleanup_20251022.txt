Horizontal merge cleanup (22 Oct 2025)
Deck: output/presentations/run_20251022_092659/GeneratedDeck_20251022_092659.pptx
Instructions: docs/22-10-25/merged_cells_analysis/merged_cells_fix_instructions.json

Summary:
- Entries reviewed: 87
- Expected summary merges retained: 27 (MONTHLY TOTAL, GRAND TOTAL, CARRIED FORWARD)
- Unexpected / empty merges remaining: 0
- Process: tools/FixHorizontalMerges.ps1 (JSON-guided split + remerge)

Notes:
- Row-height probe still reports 692 rows outside 8.4 ±0.1 pt; additional work required separately.
- Campaign vertical merges continue to fail in PostProcess script (Cell.Merge size mismatch) – now treated as a known issue pending idempotent geometry reset.
