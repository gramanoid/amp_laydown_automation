- Sources: docs/23-10-25/23-10-25.md; docs/23-10-25/BRAIN_RESET_231025.md; openspec/AGENTS.md; openspec/project.md; git log --since=2025-10-23T00:00:00+04:00; git status; git diff TODO/FIXME scan
- Git commits today: none found for 23 Oct 2025 (UTC+04)

## Work Completed Today
- PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1 now enforces fixed layouts, span normalisation, timeout guards, and writes verbose logs under docs/23-10-25/logs/02-04-postprocess_run_*.log.
- Logged four failed post-process attempts and clean-up guidance in docs/23-10-25/logs/05-postprocess_hand_off.md.
- Prototyped SanitizePrimaryColumns.ps1 and RebuildCampaignMerges.ps1 for sanitize-first pipeline; preserved baseline deck at output/presentations/baseline_20251022/GeneratedDeck_20251022_160155_baseline.pptx.

## Pending NOW Tasks (5 total, top 3 shown)
- Regenerate a fresh deck and archive the new run under docs/23-10-25/.
- Sanitize columns 1-3 across all slides before re-running COM merges.
- Execute PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1 on the sanitised deck and confirm no residual span warnings.

## Current Blockers / Issues
- Latest deck run is corrupted by legacy campaign merges; sanitizer workflow has not produced a validated deck yet.
- No row-height probe artefact exists for 23 Oct because CLI deck regeneration still times out under excessive debug logging.
- Pipeline remains unstable without geometry sanitisation, and COM automation will continue to hit Cell.Split errors on legacy decks.

## Last Known State
- Prior agent terminated hanging PowerPoint and worker pwsh processes, leaving a clean slate but no successful sanitized deck; hand-off log 05-postprocess_hand_off.md captures required follow-up steps.

## Git Status
- Branch main (tracking origin/main, no commits ahead/behind).
- Modified: amp_automation/presentation/tables.py; tools/PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1.
- Untracked: docs/10-23-25.md; additional docs/22-10-25 logs/artifacts; docs/23-10-25/ directory; scripts/ utilities; new PowerShell helpers (AuditCampaignMerges.ps1, InspectColumnSpans.ps1, ProbeRowHeights.ps1, RebuildCampaignMerges.ps1, SanitizePrimaryColumns.ps1, VerifyAllowedHorizontalMerges.ps1, PostProcessCampaignMerges backups).

## Gaps
- MISSING: Fresh deck regeneration output for 23 Oct 2025 to validate sanitizer workflow and capture row-height probe.
