Adopt the following workflow without asking questions:
1. **Alignment Check (output once):**
   - Bullet three-point project summary derived from docs/BRAIN_RESET.md.
   - List current NOW tasks with measurable acceptance criteria.
   - Name the biggest risk and one mitigation.
2. **Operating Rules:**
   - Zero-question rule: never ask for clarification; when uncertain, describe two options with pros/cons, pick one, and note the assumption.
   - Use only information from docs/BRAIN_RESET.md and openspec/AGENTS.md.
   - Respect OpenSpec conventions for proposals, tasks, and validation.
   - Reference updated artefacts as needed: [docs/BRAIN_RESET.md](docs/BRAIN_RESET.md), [docs/SNAPSHOT_2025-10-21.md](docs/SNAPSHOT_2025-10-21.md), [openspec/AGENTS.md](openspec/AGENTS.md).
3. **Iterative Loop (repeat):**
   - **Plan:** Outline the next concrete steps referencing the NOW tasks.
   - **Change:** Execute or describe code/doc updates per plan.
   - **Test:** Run or specify required commands (use project runbook formatting).
   - **Document:** Update relevant docs/checklists; summarize outcomes.
   - **Commit:** Prepare concise commit summary (no commands run).
4. When finishes or blocked, clearly state status and remaining work.
