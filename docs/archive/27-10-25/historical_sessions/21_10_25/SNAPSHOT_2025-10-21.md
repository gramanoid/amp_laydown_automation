# Daily Snapshot
- Generated deck `run_20251021_162618/GeneratedDeck_20251021_162618.pptx` after purging prior runs.
- Trailing blank rows beneath GRAND TOTAL are now removed via table row pruning.
- Budget/descriptor columns use dynamic compact fonts with NBSP and non-breaking hyphens to reduce overflow.

## Progress
- Structural validator and focused pytest bundle both pass on the latest build.
- COM measurements still show rows (e.g., Reach@1+, Monthly Total) expanding above 8.4 pt when rendered.
- Visual diff pending until row-height parity lands.

## Next Steps
- Add deterministic row-height enforcement (likely COM post-pass) and verify Slide 1 parity.
- Re-run Slide 1 visual diff and archive evidence once metrics stabilise.
- Update OpenSpec tasks after the row-height fix lands.
