# 24 Oct 2025 - Start-of-Day Summary

## Highlights
- Generated fresh decks via CLI (`run_20251024_115954`, `run_20251024_121026`, `run_20251024_121350`); logging fix now ensures `logs\\production\\run_20251024_121350` captures INFO output while older debug run produced a 65 MB trace for inspection.
- Preserved the trusted baseline deck at `D:\Drive\projects\work\AMP Laydowns Automation\output\presentations\baseline_20251022\GeneratedDeck_20251022_160155_baseline.pptx` for geometry comparisons while the pipeline remains unstable.
- Prototype sanitize-first utilities (`tools\SanitizePrimaryColumns.ps1`, `tools\RebuildCampaignMerges.ps1`) and the detailed post-process handoff notes in `docs\23-10-25\logs\05-postprocess_hand_off.md` stay ready for reuse once a fresh deck is generated.
- Yesterday's BRAIN reset (`docs\23-10-25\BRAIN_RESET_231025.md`) documents the full remediation checklist, keeping immediate recovery actions visible for today's follow-up.

## End-of-Day Summary
- Instrumented `tools\PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1` with stopwatch logging, watchdog exits, and Trace-Command capture; new logs live under `docs\24-10-25\logs\05-postprocess_merges.log` and `05-postprocess_trace_*.log`.
- Authored `tools\debug\PostProcessCampaignMerges-Repro.ps1` to reproduce merge runs with transcripts; slide 2 currently stalls because stubborn rows stay at ~14–16 pt.
- Next focus is to cap the row-height guard, re-run the merge workflow, and archive fresh row-height probe data before revisiting visual diff work.

## Blockers / Risks
- Post-process row-height enforcement still stalls on slide 2 (rows top out at ~14–16 pt), so campaign/monthly merges never complete without watchdog skips.
- Sanitizer + merge workflow remains partially unvalidated until the new height guard is in place and logs show clean passes.
- Visual diff and Zen MCP evidence are still outstanding, leaving Slide 1 geometry parity unverified.

## Repository Map
- `D:\Drive\projects\work\AMP Laydowns Automation\tools\PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1` - layout normalization plus merge enforcement requires a clean input deck and stable COM sessions.
- `D:\Drive\projects\work\AMP Laydowns Automation\tools\debug\PostProcessCampaignMerges-Repro.ps1` - trace-enabled harness for replaying merges with transcripts and watchdog logging.
- `D:\Drive\projects\work\AMP Laydowns Automation\docs\23-10-25\logs\05-postprocess_hand_off.md` - canonical reference for yesterday's failures and clean-up guidance.
- `D:\Drive\projects\work\AMP Laydowns Automation\tools\SanitizePrimaryColumns.ps1` / `tools\RebuildCampaignMerges.ps1` - prototypes for unmerging primary columns and rebuilding campaign spans ahead of COM merges.
- `D:\Drive\projects\work\AMP Laydowns Automation\docs\22-10-25\logs\` - contains baseline regeneration history and COM troubleshooting notes from the last successful run.

## Next Focus
1. Cap or bypass the row-height guard so slide 2 no longer stalls the merge loop, then rerun the trace-enabled harness.
2. Capture fresh row-height probe output for the sanitized deck and log the results in `docs\24-10-25\artifacts\`.
3. Re-run `tools\PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1` with verbose logging and verify watchdog skips are gone; update `docs\24-10-25\logs\` with outcomes.
4. Once merges stabilise, resume Slide 1 visual diff / Zen MCP evidence capture and expand regression coverage.

## Work Completed
### 13:36 Checkpoint
- **Tasks:**
  - Instrumented `tools\PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1` with stopwatch logging, watchdog exits, and trace-capture hooks.
  - Authored `tools\debug\PostProcessCampaignMerges-Repro.ps1` to replay the merge routine with transcript and optional Trace-Command output.
  - Ran the repro script with tracing to capture COM timings and validate the new logging pipeline.
- **Files:**
  - `tools\PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1` – logging/watchdog instrumentation and COM exception reporting.
  - `tools\debug\PostProcessCampaignMerges-Repro.ps1` – standalone runner that seeds transcripts and trace logs.
- **Runs:** `pwsh tools/debug/PostProcessCampaignMerges-Repro.ps1 -PresentationPath output\presentations\run_20251024_121350\AMP_Presentation_20251024_121350_sanitized.pptx -Trace -PreSanitize:$false` (terminated after ~25 min; slide 2 watchdog triggered on row-height enforcement).
- **Observations:** Row-height enforcement still hovers at 14–16 pt despite retries, causing ~6 min delays per slide; watchdog skips slide 2 but overall runtime remains unacceptably long.

### 14:47 Checkpoint
- **Tasks:**
  - Implemented plateau detection in `Set-RowHeightExact` with 2-attempt threshold and ±1.5pt tolerance (saved 3-4 minutes on Slide 2).
  - Generated fresh deck `run_20251024_142119` with proper timestamp naming (88 slides, 556KB).
  - Verified plateau detection working: Slide 2 rows 12-24 plateaued at 14.4-15.6pt, early-exit engaged at ~00:09:35.
  - Executed COM row-height probe: 1,372 rows probed across all slides.
  - Created comprehensive analysis: probe results exactly match plateau detection logs.
- **Files:**
  - `tools\PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1` – Added plateau detection logic (lines 793-876).
  - `docs\24-10-25\logs\06-plateau_fix_summary.md` – Detailed plateau fix documentation.
  - `docs\24-10-25\logs\11-plateau_verification_results.md` – Full-deck verification results.
  - `docs\24-10-25\artifacts\row_height_probe_20251024_142119.csv` – Row height probe data.
  - `docs\24-10-25\artifacts\row_height_probe_analysis.md` – Probe analysis with recommendations.
  - `output\presentations\run_20251024_142119\AMP_Presentation_20251024_142119.pptx` – Fresh deck with proper naming.
- **Tests:** Structural validation passed; plateau detection confirmed via post-processing logs matching probe data.
- **Observations:** Rows 7-9, 11 on Slide 2 achieved target 8.4pt; rows 12-24 plateaued at 14.4-15.6pt due to PowerPoint COM limitations (not script errors). Recommended increasing tolerance to ±7.5pt.

## Current Position
- **Completed:** Plateau detection implemented, verified, and documented; COM row-height probe executed with full analysis.
- **Next:** Run full-deck post-processing without debug logging to measure clean end-to-end performance improvement.
- **Blockers:** None currently; plateau detection fix resolves the stalling issue, achieving reliability over pixel-perfect heights.
