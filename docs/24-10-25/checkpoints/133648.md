## State at Checkpoint
Instrumented post-process merge script with detailed logging/watchdogs; repro harness runs but slide 2 row-height enforcement still stalls the COM loop.

## Work Completed Since Last Save
- Added stopwatch logging, watchdog breakouts, and COM tracing to `tools/PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1`.
- Created `tools/debug/PostProcessCampaignMerges-Repro.ps1` and executed trace-enabled runs against the sanitized deck.
- Captured transcripts/trace logs showing slide 2 row heights stuck at 14–16 pt and watchdog skip after ~6 minutes.

## Next Actions
- Cap or bypass row-height enforcement when retries plateau and rerun the debug harness.
- Collect row-height probe output for slide 2 to inform safe thresholds.
- Reattempt the merge once guards are in place and review the generated logs.

## Blockers
- PowerPoint COM refuses to shrink several campaign rows below ~14 pt, leading to multi-minute stalls despite retries.
