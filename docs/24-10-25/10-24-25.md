Summary
- Instrumented the PowerPoint post-process pipeline with stopwatch logging, watchdog exits, and trace capture to diagnose slide 2 stalls.

Features Added
- Added `tools\debug\PostProcessCampaignMerges-Repro.ps1` for running merge attempts with transcripts and Trace-Command output.

Bugs Fixed
- None resolved today; row-height stall remains under investigation.

Refactoring
- Reworked `tools\PostProcessCampaignMerges.ps1` control flow to centralise logging, COM exception handling, and row-height watchdog guards.

Documentation
- Updated `docs\24-10-25\24-10-25.md` and `BRAIN_RESET_241025.md` with the new instrumentation status, logs, and outstanding tasks.

Dependencies
- No dependency updates.

Testing
- Ran `tools\debug\PostProcessCampaignMerges-Repro.ps1 -Trace -PreSanitize:$false`; watchdog aborted slide 2 after ~6 minutes when row heights plateaued at 14–16 pt.

Blockers/Issues
- Campaign tables still resist 8.4 pt row-height enforcement, causing COM loops to stall until the watchdog intervenes.

Notes
- Trace logs and transcripts now live under `docs\24-10-25\logs\05-postprocess_*`; use them to pinpoint the exact COM calls when iterating rows.

Time Spent
- ≈4h on COM instrumentation, repro harness authoring, and diagnostics runs.

Next Steps
- Implement a capped row-height guard, rerun the repro harness, capture fresh row-height probe data, and resume Slide 1 visual parity checks.
