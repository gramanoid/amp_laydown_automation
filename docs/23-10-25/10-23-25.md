# Daily Changelog — 23 Oct 2025

## Summary
- Paused automation after identifying corrupted decks; preserved the last known-good PPTX and began retooling the sanitize-first workflow.

## Features Added
- None.

## Bugs Fixed
- None completed; merge pipeline remains unresolved.

## Refactoring
- Drafted `tools/SanitizePrimaryColumns.ps1` and `tools/RebuildCampaignMerges.ps1` prototypes (pending validation).

## Documentation
- Updated `docs/23-10-25/BRAIN_RESET_231025.md` and `docs/23-10-25/23-10-25.md` with the current plan and blockers.

## Dependencies
- No dependency changes today.

## Testing
- Generation CLI re-run timed out due to excessive debug logging; no successful tests completed.

## Blockers/Issues
- CLI deck generation floods logs and fails to finish; sanitize/merge prototypes corrupt campaign columns; no fresh row-height probe.

## Notes
- Baseline deck moved to `output/presentations/baseline_20251022/GeneratedDeck_20251022_160155_baseline.pptx` for safe diffing.

## Time Spent
- Most of the session troubleshooting PPTX automation and preserving baseline assets.

## Next Steps
- Quiet presentation assembly logging, regenerate a clean deck, validate sanitizer/merge workflow against the baseline, then capture row-height and visual diff artefacts.
