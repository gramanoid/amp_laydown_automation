## Summary
Aligned the pipeline’s folder conventions, refreshed documentation, and restored repository scaffolding to reflect the consolidated artifact hierarchy.

---

## Features Added
- _None_

## Bugs Fixed
- _None_

## Refactoring
- Standardized artifact layout to `00_inputs`→`08_reconciliation`, removing conflicts between orchestration outputs and housekeeping.
  - Files: `src/orchestration/artifacts.py`, `src/orchestration/run_complete_workflow.py`, `config/workflow/pipeline.json`, `src/common/folder_manager.py`, `src/common/config.py`
- Updated validation modules to emit reports/metadata into the new structure for consistent downstream consumption.
  - Files: `src/pipeline/quality/validate_accuracy.py`, `src/pipeline/quality/pca_integration_wrapper.py`, `src/pipeline/quality/post_snapshot.py`, `src/pipeline/quality/template_mapper.py`, `src/pipeline/quality/transforms.py`

## Documentation
- Refreshed project guides to describe the revised output hierarchy and metadata locations.
  - Files: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/02_architecture/PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Dependencies
- _None_

## Testing
- Ran full pytest suite to ensure structure changes introduced no regressions.
  - Command: `python -m pytest`

## Blockers/Issues
- _None_

## Notes
- Follow-up dry-run of `scripts/run_pipeline_local.py` with sample data will confirm artifact materialization under the new layout.

---

## Time Spent
- Coding: 3.0 hours
- Debugging: 0.5 hours
- Documentation: 1.0 hours
- Meetings/Planning: 0.0 hours
- Total: 4.5 hours

---

## Next Steps
- [ ] Run `scripts/run_pipeline_local.py` with representative PLANNED/DELIVERED workbooks.
- [ ] Replace placeholder regression tests with real coverage under `tests/`.
- [ ] Audit remaining documentation for any legacy path references.
