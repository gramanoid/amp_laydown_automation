# 2025-10-14 Daily Update

## Modularization Plan
- Documented a three-phase roadmap covering legacy responsibility inventory, target architecture boundaries, and staged extraction tasks required to complete the package refactor.

## Completed Work
- Replaced the stubbed `presentation.assembly` with the refactored production builder and added a configuration override so the CLI can inject alternate configs.
- Swapped the CLI to use the new assembly module, wired logging directly, and removed all references to `scripts/excel_to_ppt_v1_071025.py` before deleting the legacy file.
- Added targeted tests for ingestion edge cases, table composition, and a CLI smoke test alongside the existing chart coverage.

## Current Assessment
- **Config/Data**: Helpers expose clean parsing entry points, though `DataSet` still wraps a bare DataFrame and may need richer typed views later.
- **Presentation**: Assembly logic now lives in-package; heavy slide composition code persists but is centrally configurable.
- **CLI/Utils**: CLI executes entirely through the modular pipeline with logger/config injection support.
- **Testing**: Unit and smoke coverage exists for charts, tables, data helpers, and CLI; comprehensive slide rendering snapshots remain future work.

## Next Focus
- Monitor the modular pipeline with real inputs, trim residual duplication inside `assembly`, and consider snapshot-based slide regression tests.
